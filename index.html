            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Raka, also known online as <strong>Raizenn</strong>.
                I am an experienced Roblox Studio scripter with professional involvement since 2020.
                I currently work as a part-time freelancer specializing in Roblox Studio scripting,
                typically handling specific projects and smaller task-based assignments.
                Most of the work showcased in my portfolio is derived from commissioned projects,
                including those completed through Fiverr. I currently have two personal projects
                developed entirely by myself, which I include as part of my portfolio.
            </p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>
                    This is my first personal project: an open-sourced FPS/OTS gun system compatible with both R15 and R6.
                    It is simple yet fully customizable.
                    You can obtain it through the Roblox Creator Store or from the corresponding repository on my GitHub.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>
                    This is my second personal project: a simple jet-combat dogfight game.
                    It currently features two aircraft — the F-22 Raptor and the Su-57 Felon — and is compatible with PC only.
                    The aircraft are primarily controlled using mouse and keyboard input.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Project 3</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the first freelance project I completed, which involved developing a shield system.
                    A demonstration of the system can be viewed in the video below.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Project 4</h3>
                <p>
                    This freelance project involved developing a hard-coded Glock 17.
                    It is straightforward but fully functional.
                    A demonstration is available in the video below.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Project 5</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a larger-scale freelance project in which I worked on a game titled <em>Land of Alura</em>,
                    inspired by Pokémon-style gameplay. I was fully responsible for the scripting portion of the project.
                    A showcase of the game can be viewed in the video below.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Project 6</h3>
                <p>
                    This project is similar to Project 4, but focuses on minor fixes and small additional features
                    intended for stage or event use.
